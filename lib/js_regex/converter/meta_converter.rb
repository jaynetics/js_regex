      # Possible improvements for dot conversion:
      #
      # In ES2015, the 'u' flag allows dots to match astral chars. Unfortunately
      # the dot keeps matching lone surrogates even with this flag, so the use
      # of an expansion is still necessary to get the same behavior as in Ruby.
      #
      # ES2018 has the dotall flag 's', but it is tricky to use in conversions.
      # 's' activates matching of BOTH astral chars and "\n", whereas the dot in
      # Ruby doesn't match "\n" by default, and even with the 'm' flag set on
      # the root, subexps might still exclude "\n" like so: /.(?-m:.)./m
